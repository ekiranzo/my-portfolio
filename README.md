### Steps on how to create a Github Page:
1. Follow the documentation on how to deploy a page from https://pages.github.com/
2. Build your website.
3. Create your index.html and css file until satisfied.
4. Update and Maintain.

### What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
- Creating a front end isn't that simple, as for some have difficulties in 
producing their vision into life. A lot of things I used to make what I 
wanted to make it look like needed to be researched and needed to be read up
on documentation on certain syntaxes or methods. \
Making a proper portfolio in the future would be probably be easier with this
experience and also with the use of javascript and css frameworks.
